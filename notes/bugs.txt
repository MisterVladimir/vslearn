1) If images are loaded once, loading another folder of images crashes the
   program.

    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File ".../vslearn/vslearn/main_window.py", line 525, in display_bounding_boxes
            self.scene.hide()
        File ".../vslearn/vslearn/models/scene.py", line 109, in hide
            self._set_group_visible(_image_id, False)

            group.setVisible(visible)
        RuntimeError: wrapped C/C++ object of type WGraphicsItemGroup has been deleted
        Aborted (core dumped)

    This is probably to do with how the WGraphicsScene clears the old images,
    or something as a consequence of the image_registry_reset signal.

2) If we draw a large bounding box over a smaller one, the smaller one becomes
   impossible to select unless the larger one is moved out of the way first.

3) Importing from JSON displays deleted bounding boxes.
