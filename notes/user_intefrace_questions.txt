1) Suppose the user has loaded images into the viewer. Will the annotations
   (i.e. bounding boxes) for these images ever be loaded piecemeal? That is,
   will the user load bounding boxes from one file, and then want to load
   bounding boxes from another file?

2) It would be nice if the user could import training images and associated
   bounding boxes stored in a Tensorflow Record. However, this might complicate
   the user interface. How's that? Users can already import inference data
   stored in a Tensorflow Record by doing File -> Import from... -> Tensorflow
   Record. How (and should) we allow the user to signal they're importing
   training data?

3) When exporting data to Tensorflow Record, the user should be able to select
   which of the following subsets of images/bounding boxes is actually
   exported.
        
       (a) Only images/bounding boxes that have been reviewed by the
           user. (default)
       (b) All bounding boxes.

   Currently we do (b), which is probably not a good idea.
